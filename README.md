# DUBLOO - UW Restroom Finder & Community


Overview

This project is a web-based platform designed to help University of Washington students locate, evaluate, and share information about restrooms on campus. Built with React and Vite, the website delivers a responsive and interactive user experience, while the Google Maps API is used to visualize restroom locations across campus and support spatial exploration.

Beyond basic location services, the platform integrates a community-based rating and review system supported by Firebase as the backend database. Students can rate restrooms, leave comments, and browse others’ feedback, transforming everyday campus infrastructure into a shared information resource. Through this system, the project highlights often-overlooked aspects of accessibility and daily usability, enabling students to make more informed decisions based on cleanliness, convenience, and overall experience.

Originally developed as part of a course, this project was later refined into a portfolio version with a stronger focus on front-end architecture, API integration, and user-centered interaction design.
